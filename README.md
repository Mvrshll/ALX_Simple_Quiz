Implement a Simple Interactive Quiz

My task is to implement the JavaScript functionality for a quiz application

Create a JavaScript function named checkAnswer for a quiz application that checks if the user’s selected answer is correct and displays appropriate feedback. Add an event listener to the “Submit Answer” button to invoke this function when clicked.
